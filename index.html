      <h2>Story</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Your father left when you turned 18 and you haven't seen him since. Now, five years later, you recieve a letter in the mail from a place that sounds distantly familiar. It isn't your father, but someone who claims to be his old friend. They say your father passed away suddenly and he wanted nothing more than to show you the place he grew up. You can even stay if you want. Make a life for yourself out here on the farm. Or at least give it a shot.    </li>
        <li> You aren't sure about it, but you have always wondered about the place that called your father away from you. So you decide to visit Halcyon Valley, and maybe even stay a while. </li>
      </ul>
